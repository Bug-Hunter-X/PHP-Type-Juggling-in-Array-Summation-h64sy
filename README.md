This example demonstrates a common error in PHP involving type juggling during array summation. The function `calculateSum` intends to sum all numbers in the input array.  However, due to the presence of a non-numeric string ('4a') in the `$numbers` array, PHP's type juggling behavior leads to an incorrect result.  The solution involves explicit type checking or using a more robust approach to handle potential type mismatches.
